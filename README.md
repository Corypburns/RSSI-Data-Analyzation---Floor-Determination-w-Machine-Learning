# <ins>HOW THIS WORKS</ins>
These models work with the dataset in such a way that the model is to be 100% trained on the training portion and then 100% tested on the testing portion.
You are welcome to alter or change any of these as I did this for an undergraduate project for Applied Networking Security. If you want to split the dataset,
then I recommend scikitlearn's train-test-split library, as it offers parameters that are very helpful to the training and testing of a model if you prefer to keep it
clean and in one file. Download the dataset, change the pathing to support your downloaded path, and get to work!
